# ðŸ›° External Connection Logger with GeoIP Lookup

A PowerShell script that identifies active **external TCP connections** to your Windows system, enriches them with **GeoIP data**, and logs the results to a file. Designed for advanced threat hunting and situational awareness, especially in environments where stealthy connections may go unnoticed.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Lists active non-local TCP connections
- Filters out private/local IP addresses (loopback and RFC1918 ranges)
- Integrates with [ip-api.com](http://ip-api.com) to perform live GeoIP lookups
- Logs connection metadata with location context to a timestamped file
- Displays results in a clean, formatted output

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Run the script in PowerShell (requires Internet connection for GeoIP lookup):

```powershell
.\get_externalconnections.ps1

Output
Log file is saved to: %TEMP%\ExternalConnectionsLog.txt

Each entry includes:

Local and remote IP/port

TCP connection state

GeoIP location (city, country)

ðŸ§° Dependencies
Requires Windows PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell Core

Internet access for GeoIP resolution via Invoke-RestMethod

ðŸ›¡ Example Use Cases
Spot unusual beaconing to foreign IPs

Monitor potential C2 callbacks in real time

Document outbound traffic paths during incident response
